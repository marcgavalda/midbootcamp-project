1. Introduction
This project provides a glance at the rental market in Amsterdam as of December 2022, and offers a solution to overcome the housing shortage in the city.

2. Python notebooks
There are two notebooks in this project. The "EDA & Hypothesis testing" notebook provides an overview of the main hypothesis of the project and explains how it was tested. The "Telegram bot" notebook contains the code for the proposed solution to the housing shortage, which is a Telegram bot that notifies prospective tenants when new properties that match their criteria are available in Pararius.nl

3. Excel and CSV files
The project is based on data from December 2022, and the original dataset (in CSV format) is included in the repository. The "visualizations" Excel file provides an overview of the graphs and visualizations used in the presentation.

4. Installation and setup
To run the notebooks and use the data in this project, you will need to have Python and Jupyter installed on your computer.

Once you have Python and Jupyter installed, clone or download the repository and open the notebooks in Jupyter. You will also need to install any necessary Python packages, which are listed in the "Requirements" file. 

5. Usage
To use the Telegram bot, you will need to have a Telegram account and run the code in the "Telegram bot" notebook.
